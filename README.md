# BrightSpace Learning Management System (LMS) Enhancement Project

## Overview
The BrightSpace Learning Management System (LMS) Enhancement Project focuses on business analysis and process improvement to optimize student engagement on the college's LMS platform. This project involves conducting user research, gathering stakeholder requirements, developing business process models and use case scenarios, and defining UI specificationsâ€”all aimed at enhancing the LMS based on valuable feedback from actual stakeholders.

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of documents, diagrams, and data files that detail the design and implementation of proposed system enhancements.
