# BrightSpace Learning Management System (LMS) Enhancement Project

## Overview
The BrightSpace Learning Management System (LMS) Enhancement Project focuses on business analysis and process improvement to optimize student engagement on the college's LMS platform. The project involves gathering stakeholder requirements, creating business process models, use case models, and defining UI requirements to enhance the LMS based on feedback from real stakeholders.

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of documents, diagrams, and data files that detail the design and implementation of proposed system enhancements.
